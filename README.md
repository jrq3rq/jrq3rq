# Welcome

This is my digital sandbox—a raw fusion of tech, creativity, and unfiltered rebellion.

I’m James, aka **The Idea Alchemist** (self-appointed and proud)—an **Independent AI Agent Researcher** who dreams in code, 3D prints wild ideas, and wields emojis like a samurai.

I build AI-powered tools, storytelling frameworks, and adaptive platforms that don’t just push boundaries—they set the rulebook on fire and vibe in the ashes.

_Where AI innovation, symbolic design, and visionary chaos ignite._

- **Jungian Templates**: Raw, ready-to-roll models for characters that hit hard.
- **Personality Integration**: Hooks into MindPulse-150 for bespoke chaos.
- **Flexible Use Cases**: Games, education, AI, branding—your call, just make it epic.

_Why?_ Creators should wield archetypes like blades, not decor.

### [MindPulse-150](https://mindpulse-150.web.app/)

### [Spectrum’s Guide](https://spectrumguide-a4890.web.app/) *(private MVP)*

**An AI-powered autism support tool built for caregivers, not clinicians.**

- **Personalized Care Plans**: Tailored, non-clinical strategies for daily life stressors.
- **Sound-Enhanced PECS Boards**: Visuals with frequency cues to support communication.
- **Offline-First Storage**: Keeps control local—privacy isn’t optional.

_Why?_ My sister’s experience as a caregiver made one thing clear: the tools suck. So I built one that doesn’t.
